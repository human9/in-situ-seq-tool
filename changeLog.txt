SNAPSHOT, 2016-06-14
--------------------
- TIFF images can now be imported.
- All image types are converted on import - takes slightly longer to
  to import and uses more memory but makes zooming etc faster.
- Genes are assigned a colour when csv is first imported, this colour is
  displayed in both the tissue imageplot and network.
- Legend now stays visible in the image/plot panel
- Point scaling for different image sizes can now be altered at any point
  after data import.
- Imageplot panel now starts embedded in control panel, but can be popped into
  separate window.
- Multiple selections can be made by pressing new, and old selections are
  selectable from a combobox. Default behaviour is to overwrite existing.
- KD-Tree lib from http://home.wlu.edu/~levys/software/kd/ incorporated and
  modified to speed up euclidean distance search. Source is in /lib.
- XY data, names, and nearest neighbours are stored within the KD-Tree as
  Transcript objects.
- Checking option on Imageplot panel makes all transcripts from selected nodes
  appear.
- If image is zoomed out far enough, the image+points are cached to speed up
  scrolling.
- Various UI alterations to remove useless buttons, etc.
